# Power Efficiency

## Power

$P=I^2R$

- [ ] #todo Input Formula

Graph: $R_s$ is internal resistance

### Derive Formula $P=I^2R$

> Best situation is when $R_s = R_L$ , which gives us the maximum amount of power

## Efficiency

> Maximum efficiency is 1 (because it's a ratio)
> Condition: **$R_s = 0$** or **$R_L = \infty$**

### Output voltage (Max)
