# Lecture 3 - Power Energy

- How does a robot gain energy? â†’ Power sources/ battery
- System
  - Battery is like a water pump
  - A water pipe is like wires and resistors

Energy

- Symbol: E
- Unit: Joules (J) or sometimes in electron-volts(eV)

There is current flow between only when there is a voltage difference between those two points

A positive charge q gains energy when it moves from a point at lower voltage to a point with higher voltage

$$
E = q\times V

V = \frac{E}{q}
$$

Current is the rate of electron flow

$$
I = \frac{q}{t}
$$

Power

work done per unit time
Energy per unit time ( in electrical engineering )

- Symbol: P
- Unit: Watt (W) or J/s

Ohm's Law
$V=IR$
$Power = \frac{e}{t}$
$E=qV$
$I = \frac{q}{t}$

$ P = IV = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}$
