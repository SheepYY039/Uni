What is integral

- [ ] check contents of math chapter 3 which was taught in math 1014
- [ ] work out some questions from chapter 4
- [x] download a copy of textbook and ib math formula booklet
- [x] check classviva for available resources
- [ ] check ib notes/book for intergral information (as well as other calculus)

- [ ] review proofing methods and check what methods are in the textbook

## Questions

- What is $S_n$ bar?

<dt>necessary</dt>
<dd>if f is integradable on [a,b] f is bounded on [a,b]
</dd>
</dl>
Sufficient condition of integral::
:: if f is continous in [a,b] or boundded on [a,b] with finite discontinours potins. then f is integradable

for integrals with absolute x (|x|) we seperate it into two parts (-ve + +ve) to get the actual area
