# Chapter 4 
What is integral 

- [] check contents of math chapter 3 which was taught in math 1014
- [] work out some questions from chapter 4
- [] download a copy of textbook and ib math formula booklet 
- [] check classviva for available resources
- [] check ib notes/book for intergral information (as well as other calculus)
- [] review proofing methods and check what methods are in the textbook

## Questions 
- What is $S_n$ bar? 
---

necessary
:: if f is integradable on [a,b] f is bounded on [a,b]

Sufficient condition of integral
:: if f is continous in [a,b] or boundded on [a,b] with finite discontinours potins. then f is integradable 

for integrals with absolute x (|x|) we seperate it into two parts (-ve + +ve) to get the actual area
