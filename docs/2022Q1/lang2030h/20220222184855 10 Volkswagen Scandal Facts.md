#video #case_study

## 10 What Did Volkswagen Do?

```ad-note 
title: Background Information

- The automobile industry is subject to extensive emissions testing $\rightarrow$ Necessity to inflict as litte damage onto the environment as possible 
```
- 2008-2015 VW: Cheating on US air pollution test
- purposely altering car performance during testing & providing falsely favourable results
- During official tests: constantly meets conditions
- Road Use: 10 - 40 times the legal amount

## 9 VW's Motivation

Main: Diesel[^1] range (advertised as "clean")
- Experts say that pollution-define cleaning technology may have adverse effects on the car's performance, speed, and fuel efficiency

[1]: Diesel: a "dirty word" claimed in company's 2015 ad campaign, because it is proven to be difficult to convert, based on modern day environmental standards

## 8 How Did VW Do This

Installation of **Defeat Device Software** in over 10 million cars worldwide.

```ad-note 
title:  Defeat Device Software 

Incorporated into the vehicles pre-existing computer controls

Allows the computer system within the car to detect when it's under laboratory conditions, Based on:
- The position of the steering wheel 
- Vehicle Speed 
- Duration of Engine's operation 
- Barometric Pressure
(according to the Environmental Protection Agency)

Car will then alter its performance so that **emissions are lower than they otherwise would be**

```

## 7 How Did VW Get Caught

Initially Exposed: 2013 (Independent testing carried out by the International Council on Clean Transportation [ICCT])

ICCT was originally been testing to prove "how diesel could be a clean fuel" using VW.

```ad-quote 
title: ICCT Representative John German 
We had no cause for suspicion, we thought the vehicles would be clean.
```

The three chosen models for testing passed all lab tests.
- All BMW Models Passed both
- All VW's failed the road tests significantly

Matter passed over to the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- Then the truth was unearthed in 2015

## 6 Why Are People so Outranged?

Estimates say that up to one million extra tons of air pollution have been slyly channeled into the atmosphere by VW

Critics suggested that VW values company profit over its impact on the international environmental, not to mention customer health and wellbeing

Rather than accept climate change and adapt to it

## 5 How Did VW Respond?

1. Admitted to the "defeat device scheme" in early September 2015 (after extensive pressure from the EPA)
2. The scandal (criticised as "illegal and a threat to public health"), was made public on September 18th, 2015, prompting a massive reshuffle within VW itself
3. CEO Martin Winterkorn issued an apology, and eventually resigned from his position
	1. "I am clearing the way for a fresh start with my resignation"

## 4 How Does This Affect VW Owners?

Initial Expectation: Affected cars would be recalled, in order to update software and remove the defeat device
However: situation remained unchanged

1. September 25th 2015, Switzerland had temporarily banned the sale of VW diesel engine models

## 3 How Many Cars and Which Models Will This Affect

End of Sep 2015
- ~500,000 vehicles were affected in the US + (~11 million worldwide)

Models:
- Beetle
- Jetta
- Golf
- Passat
- Audi A3
Could all carry the defeat device if built in or after 2008

Commentators: the scandal could signal a snowball effect throughout VW in general
Could also go on to affect car manufacturers that are linked to them as well

## 2 What Kind of Changes Are Going to Be Made

- Will (Can) change in short time?? The company will have to develop an engine that is actually compatible with environmental standards
```ad-quote
title: Jake Fisher
Building an Engine involves balancing four factors - performance, emissions, durability and fuel economy

Whatever the fix is, it will likely sacrifice fuel economy and probably durability as well

```
VW sacrificed the emissions part of that balance in order to deliver high spec engine in terms of the other three factors

## 1 Will VW Recover?

Customer faith
