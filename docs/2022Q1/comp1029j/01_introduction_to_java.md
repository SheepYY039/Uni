# 01 Introduction to Java

## Focus when creating the language

1. the language should be highly portable
   - You should be able to run the program on any platform and environment
   - without having to modify the program
2. use **OOP**

## Developing Java

Java is an interpreted language

Compiled Language::
:: Source code is translated using a compiler and which allow that specific computer to run the program, but not all. It is faster but not portable

Interpreted Language::
:: Source code is translated using an interpreter, which translates the code into a computer-readable format, which can be run on any computer

## JDK

> Java Development Kit

This course uses BlueJ (IDE) so not JDK is required.
